Hello! 

I'm **Shachi Singh**, a Mechanical Engineering Undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee. I work in the field of Computational Mechanics, on the design and modeling of mechancial and biomechanical systems, and am pursuing a minor in Mathematics.

When I'm free I read (almost always fiction), go for a run or play with my dog. Sometimes, I write poems, and if I like them enough, you'll find them here.

I'm an editor for the campus News and Media body [WatchOut!](http://watchout.iitr.ac.in/) and [Kshitij-IITR's bilingual literary magazine](http://kshitij.iitr.ac.in/); and a part of the institute's Volleyball team.

Here's my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1av6wJnL_IF2qGhwBz4r6uL05DgIwTHr4-IyFUBX52mo/view?format=pdf#)
