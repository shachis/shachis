1. Music <br>
 **Poets of the fall:** Given and Denied, Cradled in love. <!-- *The first time I heard Given and Denied I fell in love with the lyrics. "Give me back my innocence 'cause I wish to dream again Like I never outgrew my old playground Where the sun sets slowly with a golden crown And the leaves sing lullabies 'round vacant swings Give me those wings" The song is an ode to all that was, that will never be. The album, apltly named "Twilight Theatre" is a performance with. "We took a gamble with this love Like sailing to the storm" "Do I even dare to speak out your name for fear It sounds like Like a lover"* --> <br>
