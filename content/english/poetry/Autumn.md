These days<br>

I don’t count the cups of coffee <br>

as my memories melt into daydreams<br>

the last car drives home at seven

and the street goes quite <br>

a lost summer bids goodbye<br>

in the wind’s cold embrace <br>

leaves turn, letting go, finally<br> 

there’s a winter I’ve been carrying inside me<br>

its spilling out <br>

these days
