We were paper boats <br>
In water, running<br>
Delicate, just a brisk breeze away<br>
from overturning<br>

We were toy trains<br>
On the same track<br>
Rushing on, destined,<br>
for the big wreck<br>

We were helium balloons <br>
In the sky, colours myriad<br>
Going up,up but doomed,<br>
To fall down, fast and hard<br>

We were candy floss<br>
Happy, pink, fluffy<br>
Vivacious but insubstantial<br>
Melting away in a jiffy<br>

We were a carousel<br>
At the carnival <br>
Going round and round<br>
but never forward.<br>
