It’s easier to miss people than loving them<br>
I give away goodbyes like candy on halloween<br>
Leaving before I’m left<br>
Hold my heart tight, lest it falls behind <br>
Cinderella’s shoe at the ball<br>
Too easy, a story, too happy<br>
Looking for the perfect fit<br>
In a kingdom of strangers <br>
To be alone with, together<br>
For tonight, a lifetime <br>
It’s easy to forgive almost everyone, but myself<br>
So I’ve learnt to say sorry in seven languages <br>
But love, in only yours

<!--Thumbnails can be enabled easily by setting the `thumbnail` parameter in the frontmatter to an image such as `"images/landscape.jpg"`. 

Make sure to copy the image the `static/images/` directory.

If put together, it will look like this (that's in fact this post's frontmatter):
