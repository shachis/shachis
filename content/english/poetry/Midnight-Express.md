*There’s a loneliness in the city* <br>
*Its corners too big to fit me<br>*
*Screaming for someone to see <br>*
*As the city sleeps<br>*
*Deaf to cacophony <br>*
*Of daily mundaneness<br>*
*I sleepwalk through the day<br>*
*Stay up late, daydreaming <br>*
*Of pineapples in may<br>*
*I’m a stranger to my house* <br>
*On nights its awake, humming <br>*
*There are gunshots in the dark<br>*
*And I turn my music loud<br>*
*To claim some space<br>*
*I look for meaning <br>*
*In every passing face<br>*
*While my love crumbles <br>*
*in the box of things <br>*
*My last lover left<br>*
<br>
