I walk the same streets, without hope. <br>
Hope to see you, a passing glance, my game of chance.<br> 
Dread crawls<br> 
worms over the grave of butterflies you left last spring. <br>
Spring doesn’t stop by anymore.<br> 
It turns up the heat. It’s a scorching summer in my town.<br> 
The one you left last week.<br>
Or last year? <br>
Days go by too fast, days go by too slow and I am drowning. <br>
But the river has dried this year. <br>
I paint your laugh. I’m underwater and it melts away. <br>
It’s the third day of fifth grade and my purple popsicle melts away and they’re all laughing and it’s too damn hot.<br>
You hand me your mango flavored ice-cream. I hate yellow. <br>
You laugh, it’s  the brightest of spring days.
