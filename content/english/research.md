Areas of Interest: CAD/CAM and Finite Element Methods; Granular Mechanics;

1) **Discrete Finite Element Analysis of behaviour of Advanced Ceramics** <br>
*Guide: Prof James Hogan | [Centre for Design of Advanced Materials](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jdhogan/index.html), University of Alberta <br> 
(June 2021 - Present)* <br>
• Exploring approaches to modelling the granular behaviour of ceramics (Boron Carbide and Alumina) to validate experimental results under the **MITACS GRI Program.**
---
2) **Impact and blast induced head injury biomechanics** <br>
*Guide: Prof Shailesh Ganpule | [Extreme Mechanics Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/extrememechanicslab/), IIT Roorkee <br> 
(September 2020 - Present)* <br>
• For this project, we studied 2D and 3D human head models under impact and ballistic loading conditions. Helmets were modeled to understand there role in mitigatinng Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). The deformations and strain patterns in the brain under standard ballistic loading conditions were studied.

3) **Simulation of Deployment of Origami Booms for Space Application** <br>
*Guide: Prof S.H. Upadhyay | [Smart Materials and Structural Lab](http://iitr-shupadhyay.weebly.com/), IIT Roorkee <br> 
(Nov 2019 - March 2020)* <br>
• Origami-folded multi storey compact inflatable booms used for deployment of large space structures were **designed on SOLIDWORKS**, and the simulation of their deployment was carried out in ABAQUS by programming an **inflator to alter the flow characteristics** of air mixture entering the during inflation. A comparison of maximum stresses and deployment features was done to determine the **best folding pattern and optimum flow characteristics**. <br>
• Preparing research publication entitled "Numerical Simulation of the Inflation process of Origami booms".

4) **Post Processing of models in MATLAB** <br>
*Aerospace Engineering Department, IIT Kanpur <br> 
(April 2020 - June 2020)* <br>
• Numerically modeled the eigenvalue solution of Beam models in MATLAB and for finding natural frequencies using mass and stiffness matrices from ABAQUS to calculate the optimum dimensions for maximum load bearing under given constraints.

5) **Finite Element Analysis of Fir-tree region of Turbine Blades** <br>
*Guide: Prof Avinash Parashar | Term Project | IIT Roorkee <br> 
(Sept 2019- Nov 2019)* <br>
• A comprehensive 2D and 3D finite element analysis of the fir tree region of aero-engine turbine blades was carried out in ANSYS for finding the effect of varying geometrical features, such as the number of teeth, flank length and flank angle, upon stress nature in the critical stress regions. <br>
• The required values for maximum operational safety and service life of the bladed disc configuration were determined.
